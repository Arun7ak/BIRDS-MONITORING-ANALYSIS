# BIRDS-MONITORING-ANALYSIS USING PYTHON AND POWER BI

Problem Statement:
The project aims to analyze the distribution and diversity of bird species in two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. By examining bird species observations across these habitats, the goal is to understand how environmental factors, such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain, influence bird populations and their behavior. The study will involve working on the provided observational data of bird species present in both ecosystems, identifying patterns of habitat preference, and assessing the impact of these habitats on bird diversity. The findings can provide valuable insights into habitat conservation, biodiversity management, and the effects of environmental changes on avian communities.

Summary of the Project: Birds Monitoring Analysis
The project focuses on analyzing data related to visits to forests and grasslands by birds. The steps involved include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, and the design of a three-page interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize insights effectively.

Simplified Steps of Birds Monitoring Analysis Project:
Step 1: Data Cleaning
          Processed the dataset to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information.
          Ensured data accuracy for parameters like "Forest Visits," "Grassland Visits," and bird-related metrics.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
          Performed a thorough analysis of trends, distributions, and patterns in the dataset.
          Used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for statistical summaries and visualizations.
Step 3: Dashboard Design
          Created a Power BI dashboard with three pages to showcase key insights:
          Forest Visits Analysis: Highlighted trends in bird visits to forests, seasonality, and species activity.
          Grassland Visits Analysis: Focused on grassland visitation patterns and species diversity.
          Comparative Insights: Combined data to present comparative visuals and overall monitoring trends.
Step 4: Insights and Conclusions
          Identified significant trends and patterns in bird visits across different habitats.
          Highlighted actionable insights for conservation efforts and habitat management.
